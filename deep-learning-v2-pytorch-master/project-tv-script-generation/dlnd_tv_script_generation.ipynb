    "**Answer:** I have choosen my parameters based on the exercise from sentiment analysis and on my research on what other have done. Surprisingly, I found the loss to easily reduce to the value expected by the projet - don't if it was something supposed to be easy or not or I just added a big NN. I have read that smaller sequences should allow the loss to descrease faster, whereas higher sequences make the model more \"precise\". That doesn't seem the case, imho, as senteces don't make much sense. That seem a limitation of the model, however. GANs seem to be much more powerful to create cohesive contexts, and I believe we can generate much better predictions with them.\n"
